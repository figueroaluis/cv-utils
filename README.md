# Utility functions for Computer Vision tasks

Honestly, sometimes I'm too lazy to find what I'm looking for, and if I find it, I tend to forget where I found it.  

I also tend to reimplement a lot of trivial functions so this is my attempt to keep track of them. I can also store functions from other repositories here, for my own convenience. :) 

I'll come back to my repo and copy-paste them!
